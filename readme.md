## How to use this workbook

As you progress through the course, your mentor will direct you toward various resources in the exercise sets in this workbook for additional review and practice.

They will also keep track of your skill mastery and conceptual understanding in the skills checklists. These checklists also serve as an overview of the wide array of skills and concepts you'll be learning throughout the course so you can get a sense of the big picture.

Assessment reviews are additional exercise sets specifically designed to aid in preparing for assessments.

*Have fun!*
